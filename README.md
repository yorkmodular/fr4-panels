# FR4 Panel Files

These directories contain the files necessary to fabricate FR4 panels for a number of my Eurorack modules.
Due to the costs involved, I am not able to supply panels on their own in small quantities, so these files are placed here in the event that they may be useful to some people.

Use these if you either a) want to replace an old/broken perspex panel and/or b) want to customise the existing design and get it fabbed.

*The files are all supplied AS-IS* - they're generally the same ones that I send for fabbing when I'm doing a run of modules.
